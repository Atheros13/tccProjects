CURRENTLY THIS IS ONLY IN THE IDEA STAGE - IT SEEMS A LOT OF WORK FOR LITTLE WORTH

This is a secondary project program. As Remedy can only run a process which either sends or receives data, 
(as far as I currently know 05/02/21) this is a work around. The main_action_email.py program will run
and create a .txt which has data which this program will return to remedy. It will then delete the .txt file.
